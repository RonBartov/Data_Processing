# Factory Data Processing
The project main goal is to understand and analyze data sets that contains information about devices that were tested in factory. 
The data composes of two different datasets:
1) Factory test data- contains 51 samples from different devices measurements
2) New devices data- contains 3 new samples
3) 
## Main Sections
### 1) Data loading and description
Load the 'factory test data' and provide a description of its contents.

### 2) Data preprocessing
Initial process on the 'factory test data' before visualizing and analyzing it.

### 3) Data visualization and explanation
Display plots that will present some important relations between different features in the 'factory test data'.  

### 4) Data exploration
Investigate the relation between the main samples data and 'new devices data' samples.

### 5) Suggest new testing method
Suggest and implement a testing method for new devices based on the properties of the 'factory test data'. 

**The python notebook also contains explanation about each section**
